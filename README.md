# Census_Data
In this small project, I explore the socioeconomic landscape of the United States using median income data obtained from the US Census Bureau. The dataset provides valuable insights into the income distribution across different regions, as delineated by ZIP codes.

The project begins with the meticulous cleaning and preparation of the raw census data, ensuring its accuracy and reliability for subsequent analysis. Leveraging data cleaning techniques, we address missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies to produce a refined dataset ready for visualization.

With the cleaned data in hand, we embark on the visualization phase, where we employ mapping techniques to depict the geographical distribution of median income across the nation.
